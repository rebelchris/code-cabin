    id: "let-them-lead",
    title: "Let Them Lead",
    age: "2.5 years",
    date: "October 2025",
    timeInvestment: "None - just a reframe",
    whatWeTried:
      'Instead of asking Quinn to get dressed for bedtime (which sometimes turned into debates), we changed the frame: "Show us how you can do it yourself!"',
    whatHappened:
      "The shift was immediate. He lights up with pride showing us he can do it. What used to be occasional resistance became a routine he actually looks forward to. He's in control, we're the audience cheering him on.",
    whyItWorked:
      "Turns out the resistance wasn't about getting dressed - it was about being told what to do. When he became the one showing off his skills instead of following instructions, the whole dynamic flipped.",
    theLesson: "Sometimes the activity isn't the problem - the framing is.",

  {
    id: "cardboard-city",
    title: "Building a Cardboard City",
    age: "3 years",
    date: "March 2024",
    timeInvestment: "2 hours (spread across an afternoon)",
    whatWeTried:
      "Saved up delivery boxes for a week and spent an afternoon turning them into buildings. We had tape, markers, and zero architectural plans.",
    whatHappened:
      "The tape situation got completely out of hand. We went through two rolls. But watching him design windows, doors, and a 'parking garage' was worth every sticky moment. The city stood in our living room for three days.",
    whyItWorked:
      "Open-ended building projects let kids be the architects. No instructions meant no wrong answers. Plus, the boxes were free and guilt-free to destroy.",
    theLesson: "The best toys are often the ones that came with something else inside.",

  {
    id: "backyard-bug-hunt",
    title: "The Great Backyard Bug Hunt",
    age: "2.8 years",
    date: "March 2024",
    timeInvestment: "45 minutes",
    whatWeTried:
      "Armed with a magnifying glass from the dollar store and a notebook, we set out to discover what lives in our backyard.",
    whatHappened:
      "We found more residents than expected. Mostly ants. So many ants. But also a beetle, some pill bugs, and one very startled spider. He insisted on drawing each discovery.",
    whyItWorked:
      "Kids are natural scientists - they just need permission to look closely. The magnifying glass made everything feel official and important.",
    theLesson: "You don't need to go anywhere special. Your backyard is already full of tiny adventures.",

  {
    id: "baking-soda-volcano",
    title: "Kitchen Science: Baking Soda Volcano",
    age: "3.2 years",
    date: "March 2024",
    timeInvestment: "30 minutes (plus cleanup)",
    whatWeTried:
      "The classic experiment. Built a volcano from playdough, added baking soda, then vinegar with food coloring for the eruption.",
    whatHappened:
      "Three eruptions later, we learned about chemical reactions. The kitchen learned about vinegar stains. He wanted to do it 'one more time' approximately seven times.",
    whyItWorked:
      "It's dramatic, it's safe, and it's repeatable. The cause-and-effect is immediate and satisfying. Plus, you probably have everything you need already.",
    theLesson: "Sometimes the classics are classics for a reason.",

  {
    id: "ice-cube-painting",
    title: "Painting with Ice Cubes",
    age: "2.6 years",
    date: "February 2024",
    timeInvestment: "20 minutes (plus freezing time)",
    whatWeTried:
      "Froze washable paint in ice cube trays with popsicle sticks. Once frozen, used them like crayons on paper.",
    whatHappened:
      "The melting was messy. The art was abstract. The sensory experience was fascinating. He loved watching the colors blend as the ice melted.",
    whyItWorked:
      "It combines painting with a totally different texture and temperature. The melting ice adds an element of time and change that regular painting doesn't have.",
    theLesson: "Art doesn't have to be about the final product. Sometimes it's about the weird, wonderful process.",

  {
    id: "shadow-tracing",
    title: "Shadow Tracing Adventures",
    age: "3.1 years",
    date: "January 2024",
    timeInvestment: "30 minutes",
    whatWeTried:
      "On a sunny morning, we taped large paper to the floor and traced shadows of toys, hands, and anything else we could find.",
    whatHappened:
      "He was amazed that shadows could be 'caught' on paper. We traced his favorite dinosaur in different positions, creating a shadow story.",
    whyItWorked:
      "It's magic that's also science. Shadows are free, endlessly variable, and introduce concepts like light, position, and shape in a hands-on way.",
    theLesson: "The best learning tools are often free and all around us.",
